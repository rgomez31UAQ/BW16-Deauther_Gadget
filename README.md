git clone https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino.git
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Board Setup (If you need to modify the sketch)

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to `File > Preferences`
3. Add ESP32 board URL to Additional Board Manager URLs: 
```
https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
```
4. Open `Tools > Board > Board Manager`
5. Search "esp32" and install "esp32 by Espressif Systems"
6. Select `Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32C5 Dev Module`

### Step 2: Upload Sketch

> Recommended method is the first method

### Method 1 (Upload via Image Uploader)

1. Download the latest image uploader from [the Release page](https://github.com/warwick320/Nova-X-5G-Deauther/releases/tag/image_uploader)
2. Open image uploader
3. Select the COM port to which the ESP32-C5 is connected
4. Click Upload

### Method 2 (Upload via Sketch)

> Before upload sketch you need to patch your esp32 compiler - [patcher](https://github.com/7h30th3r0n3/Evil-M5Project/tree/main/utilities/deauth_prerequisites) - ex) [platform.txt](https://github.com/7h30th3r0n3/Evil-M5Project/blob/main/utilities/deauth_prerequisites/plateform.txt)

1. Open `nova-x-esp32c5/nova-x-esp32c5.ino`
2. Configure board settings:
   - Board: ESP32C5 Dev Module
   - Upload Speed: 115200
   - Flash Frequency:  80MHz
   - Flash Mode: QIO
   - Partition Scheme:  Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)
3. Select correct COM port
4. Click Upload

### Step 3: Serial Monitor

```
Tools > Serial Monitor
Baud Rate: 115200
```


## Usage
